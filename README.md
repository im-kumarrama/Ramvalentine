- "Yes" button **confirms love** with a fun alert message.
- Beautiful **Valentine's Day theme** with a soft pink background.
- Simple, **easy-to-edit** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📌 How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
2. Try clicking "No" (spoiler: You can't! 😆).
3. Click "Yes" and enjoy the surprise!
